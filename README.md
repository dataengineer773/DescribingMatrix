We	want	to	describe	the	shape,	size,	and	dimensions	of	the	matrix, The	Solution is the	shape,	size,	and	ndim	attributes	of	a	NumPy	object, This	might	seem	basic	(and	it	is);	however,	time	and	again	it	will	be	valuable	to	check	the	shape	and
size	of	an	array	both	for	further	calculations	and	simply	as	a	gut	check	after	some	operation.
